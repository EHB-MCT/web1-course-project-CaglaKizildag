        <p>In this paragraph I will let you know about my language skills.</p>
        <p>Turkish is my mother tongue, so the first language I heared was Turkish.</p>
        <p>I always went to school in Dutch, so i can use the Dutch language very good!</p>
        <p>Since I was 9 years old, I learned the French language. I can use the basic French language but at the
            grammer
            I'm not very good at it.</p>
        <p>When I was at the secondary school, I learned English and it was my favorite subject at the secondary
            school.
        </p>
        <p>On my last 2 years at the secondary school I learned German.</p>
        <p>Si, hablo Espagnol! I'm nowadays also learing Spanish!</p>
        <p>I also want to learn Greek, Russian and Polish.</p>
        <h2 id="my work experiences">My work experiences</h2>
        <p> I did 3 week an internship at a tiles company called Giovanni Tiles in Vilvoorde.</p>
        <p>Since august, I work in a daycare as a childcare worker</p>
        <p>I love doing make-up very much, I'm also a freelance make-up artist.</p>

        <h2 id="my dreams">My dreams</h2>
        <p>Now let's talk a little bit about my dreams!</p>
        <p>First things first, I'm a big Harley Davidson fan, so my biggest dream is to do a touring in
            Europe with
            my
            Harley!</p>
        <p>My another dream is to open my own make-up studio and not only in Belgium, but in different
            countries!
        </p>
        <p>I also want to get my own company, being famous with my company and working with different brands
            that
            are
            famous.</p>
        <h2 id="more information about myself">More information about myself</h2>
        <p>In my free time I like to watch sitcoms, surfing on the internet and going to the gym. When I'm
            with my
            friends
            we like to hang out and to drink something!I'm also addicted to shopping I like and love
            shopping a lot.
            My
            favorite animal is a squirrel. I'm always happy when I'm eating good food.</p>
